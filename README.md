Simple C++ console game with battle characters.

Characters have roll "dice" to determine attacks and defense stats.
Once a character has 0 strength points, that character has died.
Once one team has been entirely killed off, the other tema wins.

Each character type has different armor and strengt points, and
most characters have a special ability.
